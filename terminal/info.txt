FakeOS WebAssembly Terminal - Info

This little terminal is an experiment built with:

  - C language
  - Emscripten (to run C in the browser)
  - SDL2 + SDL_ttf for graphics and text

Purpose:

  - It's just for fun! 
  - You can navigate through my website using commands like 'open', 'ls', or 'cat'.
  - Think of it as a playful "FakeOS" interface.
  - Not meant for serious computing, hacking, or productivity. 

Have fun exploring!
